# SLEAP notebooks

Here are Jupyter notebooks you can run to try [SLEAP](https://github.com/murthylab/sleap) on [Google Colaboratory](https://colab.research.google.com) (Colab). Colab is great for running training and inference on your data if you don't have access to a local machine with a [supported GPU](https://sleap.ai/guides/installation.html#gpu-support).

## Training and inference on an example dataset

In this notebook we'll show you how to install SLEAP on Colab, download a dataset from the [repository of sample datasets](https://github.com/murthylab/sleap-datasets), run training and inference on that dataset using the SLEAP [command-line interface](https://sleap.ai/guides/reference.html#command-line-interfaces), and then download the predictions.

This notebook can be a good place to start since you'll be able to see how training and inference work without any of your own data and without having to edit anything in the notebook to get it to run currectly.
